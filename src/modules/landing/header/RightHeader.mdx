# Right Header

Content of the right section of the header. Mainly used in the Landing pages.

This component relies on the `AuthContext` to render its content based on whether there is a currently authenticated user.

The look of the component for **Unauthenticated** users:
<Canvas of={RightHeaderStories.Unauthenticated} />

And for **Authenticated** users:
<Canvas of={RightHeaderStories.Authenticated} />
